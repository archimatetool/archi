<h2>Palette Creation Tools</h2>
<p>Apart from the <a href="view_palette_tools.html">Selection Tools</a> there are other tools available on the Palette used to create new ArchiMate elements, Notes, Groups and Relations between elements (connections). To add a new element or to the canvas select one and drag it onto or click onto the canvas.</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>There are eleven types of ArchiMate relation and three types of junction elements (the latter are not strictly connections but they are grouped with the relations on the Palette).</p>

This is followed by creation tools for Specialisation, Composition, Aggregation, Assignment, Realisation, Triggering, Flow, Used By, Access and Association relations. Junctions follow these.</p>

<p class="boxout"><strong><img src="img/tip.png" alt="" width="13" height="18"> Tip: Press the shift key when selecting a palette tool to keep it selected</strong><br>
  <br>
By  default, once an element or connection has been drawn on the canvas the default  selection tool (arrow) is re-selected on the palette. If you wish to keep the  current palette tool selected hold the &ldquo;Shift&rdquo; key down when you select it. </p>
