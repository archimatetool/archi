<h2>Adding Elements Directly to the Model Tree</h2>
<p>To add new ArchiMate elements directly to the Model Tree,  select one of the folders, &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Application&quot;, &quot;Technology&quot; or  &quot;Connectors&quot; and right-click. A &quot;New&quot; menu item allows you to add new elements  to the tree:</p>

Adding a new element directly to the Model Tree</p>
<p>When the element is added to the Model Tree, the focus is given to the element and you can provide a new name for it.</p>
<p>Note that it is not possible to add relationships directly  to the Model Tree as these can only be added by drawing them in the View  (diagram) editor window.</p>
