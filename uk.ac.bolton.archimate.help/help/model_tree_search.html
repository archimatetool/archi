<h2>Searching and Filtering in the Model Tree</h2>
<p>The number of elements in the Model Tree can grow quite  considerably as you work on your model. Of course, you may wish to add  sub-folders within the main folder structure to help organise your elements.  However, finding a particular element in the tree may still prove to be difficult.</p>
<p>In order to search the Model Tree a Search Bar is included  in Archi. This is accessed by clicking on the &quot;Search&quot; button on the toolbar of  the Model Tree window. Clicking this button reveals the Search Bar:</p>

The Search Bar revealed</p>
<p>As you type into the text field of the Search Bar the Model  Tree updates to show only those elements that match the search criteria in the  Search Bar. By default only the name of the elements is matched to the search  string. You can also search on the &quot;Documentation&quot; field of the elements by  ticking this in the &quot;Filter Options&quot; drop-down menu in the Search Bar:</p>

Searching on both  &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Documentation&quot;</p>
<p>To clear the text selection click on the icon to the right  of the text. To clear the filters, deselect &quot;Name&quot; and/or &quot;Documentation&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Filtering Element Types</h3>
<p>To filter certain types of ArchiMate element you can select the  different types to include in the filter/search in the drop-down menu:</p>

<p>To reset the element-type filter, select the &quot;Reset Filters&quot; menu item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Filtering User Properties</h3>
<p>To filter User Properties of elements you can select the  different Property keys to include in the filter/search in the drop-down menu:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Showing All Folders</h3>
<p>As  you refine your search the Model Tree will only show those elements that match  your search/filter criteria (or none at all if no elements match). Thus,  folders with no matching child elements are not shown. If however you wish to  show these empty folders as you search for elements (you may wish to drag and  drop elements to other folders, for example) then you can set this as an option  in the filter menu by selecting &quot;Show All Folders&quot;.</p>
<p>To close the Search Bar and reset the search filter press the  &quot;Search&quot; button one more time.</p>
