      <description>
         This cheat sheet shows you how to create a Map View of your existing Views. A Map View contains graphical boxes that are shortcuts that when double-clicked will open the linked View.<br/>
<br/>
You can create these manually by dragging a View from the tree to an open Diagram view.<br/>
<br/>
This cheat sheet can create one for you automatically, provided you have the Model Tree View open, that you have an Archimate model selected in the tree and the model has more than one View.

         Firstly, you need to ensure that the Model Tree is open. You can either do that manually from the <b>Window &gt; Models</b> main menu or from this cheat sheet automatically.
