        <p>A <b>Technology Function</b> represents a collection of technology behaviour that can be performed by a Node.</p>

        <p>A Technology Function describes the internal behaviour of a Node; for the user of a Node that performs a Technology Function, this function is invisible. If its behaviour is exposed externally, this is done through one or more Technology Services. A Technology Function abstracts from the way it is implemented.</p>

        <p>A Technology Function may realize Technology Services. Technology Services of other Technology Functions may serve Technology Functions. A Technology Function may access Technology Objects. A Node may be assigned to a Technology Function (which means that the Node performs the Technology Function).</p>
        
        <p>The name of a Technology Function should preferably be a verb ending with "ing".</p>
