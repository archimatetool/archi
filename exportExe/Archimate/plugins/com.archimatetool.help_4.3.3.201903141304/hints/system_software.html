        <p><b>System Software</b> represents software that provides or contributes to an environment for storing, executing, and using software or data deployed within it.</p>

        <p>System Software is a specialization of a Node that is used to model the software environment in which Artifacts run. Usually, System Software is combined with a Device representing the hardware environment to form a general Node.</p>

        <p>A Device or System Software can be assigned to other System Software; e.g., to model different layers of software running on top of each other. System Software can be assigned to Artifacts, to model that these Artifacts are deployed on that software. System Software can realize other System Software. A Node can be composed of System Software.</p>

        <p>The name of System Software should preferably be a noun referring to the type of execution environment.</p>
