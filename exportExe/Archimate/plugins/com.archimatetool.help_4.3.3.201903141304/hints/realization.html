        <p>The Realization relationship links a logical entity with a more concrete entity that realizes it.</p>
        
        <p>The Realization relationship indicates how logical entities ("what" or "logical"), such as services, are realized by means of more concrete entities ("how" or "physical").</p>
        
        <p>A Business Process or Function may realize a Service. A Data Object may realize a Business Object. An Artifact may realize an Application Component.</p>

        <p> An Application Component, "Financial Application", realizes a "Billing" Service.<br>
            A "Billing" Data Object realizes the Business Object, "Invoice".</p>
