        <p>A <b>Node</b> represents a computational or physical resource that hosts, manipulates, or interacts with other computational or physical resources.</p>
        
        <p>Nodes are elements that perform technology behaviour and execute, store, and process technology objects such as Artifacts. For instance, Nodes are used to model application platforms.

        <p>Nodes can be interconnected by Paths. A node may be assigned to an Artifact to model that the Artifact is deployed on the Node.</p>

        <p>The name of a Node should preferably be a noun. A node may consist of sub-nodes.</p>
