        <p>The <b>Aggregation relationship</b> indicates that a concept groups a number of other concepts.</p>
        
        <p>In contrast to the Composition relationship, an object can be part of more than one Aggregation.</p>
   	
        <p>Aggregation is always possible between two instances of the same concept.</p>
