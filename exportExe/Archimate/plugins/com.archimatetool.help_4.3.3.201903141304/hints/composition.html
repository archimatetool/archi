        <p>The <b>Composition relationship</b> indicates that an object consists of a number of other objects.</p>
        
        <p>In contrast to the Aggregation relationship, an object can be part of only one composition.</p>

        <p>A Composition relationship is always allowed between two instances of the same element type.</p>
