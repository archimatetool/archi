    <h2>Opening a View</h2>
    
    <p>If the model already contains a View it will be visible in the "Views" folder in the Model Tree:</p>

    <p>To open and edit the View, double-click it in the Model Tree (or press  Ctrl-Shift-O / Command-Shift-O). The View Editor will open showing the editing canvas and palette:</p>

    <h2>Creating a New View</h2>
    <p>An ArchiMate model usually consists of more than one View. To add a new View to the model, right-click on the "Views" folder in the Model Tree and select "New-&gt;ArchiMate View" from the context menu:</p>

    <p class="caption">Adding a new View to a Model</p>
    
    <p>Once the View has been added to the model it can be opened from the tree by double-clicking on it. Any number of Views can be added to a model and be open at the same time. Views are arranged in tabs in the main editing area of the application window.</p>
