    <h1 class="pagebreak">The Properties Window</h1>
    
    <p>The Properties Window allows you to edit the properties for selected elements in the Model Tree or selected figures or connections in a View. Some properties (for example, the name) are shared between an element in the Model Tree and its counterpart in a View. Some properties are only relevant for an element in a View (fill colour and font, for example).</p>
    
    <p>To edit the Properties for selected elements or relationships in the Model Tree or in a View, select the tree node(s) or element(s) in the View and open the Properties Window either by double-clicking the tree node or View element, or from the main "Window" menu or main toolbar.</p>
    
    <br/>
    
    <p class="boxout"><img src="../Images/tip.png" class="tipImage" alt="tip" />Note - some properties are only available when the element is selected in a View (for example, fill colour or line width).</p>
