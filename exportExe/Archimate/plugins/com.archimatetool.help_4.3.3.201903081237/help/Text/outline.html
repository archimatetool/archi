    <h1 class="pagebreak">The Outline Window</h1>
    
    <p>The Outline window acts as a miniature viewport onto the selected diagram View in order to aid in navigation if the diagram is too large to fit in the window.</p>
    
    <p>To open or close the Outline window, choose the option from  the main "Window" menu or from the main toolbar.</p>
    <p>If the View that is being edited is too large to fit into the application's window then a navigation pane will appear in the Outline window. Dragging this navigation pane will scroll the elements into view in the drawing canvas.</p>
