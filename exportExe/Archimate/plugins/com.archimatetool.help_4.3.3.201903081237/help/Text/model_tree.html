    <h1 class="pagebreak">The Model Tree</h1>
    
    <p>An ArchiMate model consists of a number of ArchiMate elements belonging to different "layers" - the "Business" layer, the "Application" layer and the "Technology" layer. Each ArchiMate element belongs to one of  these layers. For example, a "Business Object" belongs to the "Business" layer and an "Application Component" belongs to the Application layer.</p>
    
    <p>Each element in the model can connect to one or more other  elements via one or more relationships (connections) according to the rules of ArchiMate.</p>
    
    <p>It is beyond the scope of this guide to explain these  elements and their relationships. For more information refer to the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/archimate3-doc/toc.html">ArchiMate Specification</a>)</p>
    
    <p>An ArchiMate model consists of configurations of these  elements connected to each other via the various relationships. An ArchiMate model is represented in Archi in the "Models" window as a tree structure organised into folders:</p>

    <p>Each ArchiMate element and relationship is placed into its appropriate folder in the Model Tree.</p>
