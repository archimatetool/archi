    <h2>Alignment Tools, Guides and the Grid</h2>
    
    <p>In order to facilitate the drawing of pleasing diagrams,  various alignment tools are provided. These are available from the main "View-&gt;Position" menu item, from the main toolbar or by right-clicking on the diagram's canvas area to select the "Position" menu items. These are as follows:</p>
    
    <table>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Zoom in / Zoom out / Actual Size:</strong></td>
        <td>Zoom in and out of the diagram.  This is also available on the toolbar as a combo box. You can also Zoom in and out by holding the Ctrl key and scrolling the mouse wheel.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Snap to Grid:</strong></td>
        <td>Snaps elements to the Grid whether it is visible or not. (Grid spacing can be set in <a href="prefs_diagram.html">Preferences</a>.)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Grid Visible:</strong></td>
        <td>Toggles the  visibility of the Grid. (Grid spacing can be set in <a href="prefs_diagram.html">Preferences</a>.)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Snap to Alignment Guides:</strong></td>
        <td>These are blue alignment guides (lines) that appear when elements are dragged in a diagram. They assist in lining the edges and centres of elements.</td>

      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Align Left:</strong></td>
        <td>When two or more elements are selected align on the left edge of the primary selection.</td>
