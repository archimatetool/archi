    <h2>Setting the Connection Router Type for a View</h2>
    
    <p>By default, connections are drawn as straight lines from element to element. Bend-points can be added to a connection as detailed <a href="view_conn_bendpoints.html">here</a>. However, it is possible to set the overall connection router type so that the connections route around elements or are drawn orthogonally.</p>
    
    <p>The connection router type can be set either from the main "View-&gt;Connection Router" menu or by right-clicking on a View or from the "Appearance" tab in the <a href="properties_view.html">Properties Window</a> when the View canvas is selected.</p>

    <p class="boxout"><img src="../Images/tip.png" class="tipImage"/>Apart from the view specific settings, the global setting <a href="prefs_connections.html#useorthogonalconnectionanchors">Use orthogonal connection anchors</a> from the <a href="prefs_connections.html">Connection Preferences</a> tab can be used to change the way connections are drawn.</p>
    
    <p>The available router types are as follows:</p>
    
    <h3>Manual</h3>
    
    <p>Connections are drawn in straight lines. Bend-points can be added by the user.</p>

    <h3>Manhattan</h3>
    
    <p>Connections are routed orthogonally. Bend-points <em>cannot</em> be added by the user.</p>
