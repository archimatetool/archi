        <p>A <b>Junction</b> is used to connect relationships of the same type. A Junction may have multiple incoming relationships and one outgoing relationship, one incoming relationship and multiple outgoing relationships, or multiple incoming and outgoing relationships.</p>
        
        <p>The relationships that can be used in combination with a Junction are all the dynamic relationships, as well as Assignment, Realization, and Association. A Junction is used to explicitly express that several elements together participate in the relationship (and Junction) or that one of the elements participates in the relationship (or Junction).</p>

        <p>Ensure that only relationships of the same type are used to connect elements and Junctions.</p>

        <p>There are two types - <em>And</em> and <em>Or</em>.</p>
