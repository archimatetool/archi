        <p>The <b>Influence</b> relationship is used to describe that some motivational element may influence (the realization of) another motivational element.</p>
        
        <p>An influence by some other motivational element may affect this degree positively or negatively</p>
        
        <p>Attributes can be used to indicate the sign and/or strength of the influence. The choice of possible attribute values is left to the modeler; e.g., {++, +, 0, -, --} or [0..10]. By default, the Influence relationship models a contribution with unspecified sign and strength.</p>
