        <p>A <b>Data Object</b> represents data structured for automated processing.</p>
        
        <p>A Data Object should be a self-contained piece of information with a clear meaning to the business, not just to the application level.</p>

        <p>A Data Object typically models an object type of which multiple instances may exist in operational applications.</p>

        <p>An Application Function or process can operate on Data Objects. A Data Object may be communicated via interactions and used or produced by Application Services. A Data Object can be accessed by an Application Function, Application Interaction, or Application Service. A Data Object may realize a Business Object, and may be realized by an Artifact. A Data Object may have Association, Specialization, Aggregation, or Composition relationships with other Data Objects.</p>
        
        <p>The name of a Data Object should preferably be a noun.</p>
