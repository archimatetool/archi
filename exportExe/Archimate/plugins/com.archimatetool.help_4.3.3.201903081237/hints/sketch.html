        <p>A free Sketch area in which to map out your ideas.</p>
        <p>You can add new "Stickies" to the View, an "Actor" figure and connections.</p>
        <p>There are no rules as to what the relationships or stickies mean. All elements can be edited in the Properties Window.</p>
        <p>You are free to capture a sketch of your model and then later convert it into a fully realized ArchiMate model and View.</p>
