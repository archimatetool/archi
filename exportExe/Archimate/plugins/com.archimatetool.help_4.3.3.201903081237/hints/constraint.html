        <p>A <b>Constraint</b> is defined as a restriction on the way in which a system is realized.</p>
        
        <p>This may be a restriction on the implementation of the system (e.g., specific technology that is to be used), or a restriction on the implementation process (e.g., time or  budget constraints).</p>
