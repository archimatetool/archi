        <p>A <b>Business Collaboration</b> is defined as a (possibly temporary) configuration of two or more <em>Business Roles</em> resulting in specific collective behaviour in a particular context.</p>
   	
   	<p>Unlike a single Business Role, a Business Collaboration does not necessarily have a permanent status in an organisation. Thus it may be a temporary collaboration. It may not require a special name and can be regarded as a "virtual" role.</p>
   	
   	<p>A Business Collaboration can occur when two or more Business Roles need to fulfil specific interaction requirements. Business Collaborations represent the collective effort of combined Business Roles. </p>
   	
   	<p>The name of a Business Collaboration should preferably be a noun.</p>
