        <p>A <b>Business Actor</b> is defined as an entity that performs behaviour in an organisation such as business processes or functions.</p>
        
        <p>Typically, a Business Actor performs the behaviour assigned to one or more Business Roles. It's important to separate the actor from the role because a Business Actor can perform more than one Business Role, and a Business Role can be performed by more than one Business Actor.</p>
        
        <p>Business Actors are humans, departments, and business units. They may be individuals or groups.</p>
        
        <p>The name of a Business Actor should preferably be a noun.</p>
