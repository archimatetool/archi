       	<p>An <b>Implementation Event</b> is a behaviour element that denotes a state change related to implementation or migration.</p>
       	
       	<p>Work Packages may be triggered or interrupted by an Implementation Event. Also, work packages may raise events that trigger other behaviour. Unlike a Work Package, an event is instantaneous: it does not have duration.</p>

        <p>An Implementation Event may have a time attribute that denotes the moment or moments at which the event happens.</p>

        <p>Implementation Events access Deliverables to fulfil project objectives.</p>

        <p>An Implementation Event may trigger or be triggered (raised) by a Work Package or a Plateau. An Implementation Event may access a Deliverable and may be composed of other Implementation Events.</p>

        <p>An Implementation Event may be associated with any core element; e.g., to indicate a lifecycle state change.</p>
        
        <p>The name of an Implementation Event should preferably be a verb in the perfect tense.</p>
