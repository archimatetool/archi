        <p>The <b>Assignment relationship</b> links active elements (e.g., Business Roles or Application Components) with units of behaviour that are performed by them, or Business Actors with Business Roles that are fulfilled by them.</p>

        <p>The Assignment relationship represents the allocation of responsibility, performance of behavior, storage, or execution.</p>

        <p>As with all structural relationships, an Assignment relationship can also be expressed by nesting the model elements. The direction of the relationship is also the direction of nesting.</p>
