        <p>A <b>Location</b> represents a conceptual or physical place or position where concepts are located (e.g., structure elements) or performed (e.g., behavior elements).</p>
        
        <p>The Location element is used to model the places where (active and passive) structure elements such as business actors, application components, and devices are located. This is modeled by means of an aggregation relationship from a location to structure element. A location can also aggregate a behavior element, to indicate where the behavior is performed.</p>
