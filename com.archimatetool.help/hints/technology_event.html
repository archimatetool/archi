        <p>A <b>Technology Event</b> represents a technology state change.</p>
        
        <p>Technology Functions and other technology behaviour may be triggered or interrupted by a Technology Event. Also, Technology Functions may raise events that trigger other infrastructure behaviour. An event is instantaneous: it does not have duration. Events may originate from the environment of the organization, but also internal events may occur generated by, for example, other devices within the organization.</p>
        
        <p>A Technology Event may trigger or be triggered (raised) by a Technology Function, Process, or Interaction. A Technology Event may access a Data Object and may be composed of other Technology Events. The name of a Technology Event should preferably be a verb in the perfect tense.</p>
