        <p>A <b>Business Collaboration</b> represents an aggregate of two or more business internal active structure elements that work together to perform collective behavior.</p>

        <p>Unlike a single Business Role, a Business Collaboration does not necessarily have a permanent status in an organisation. Thus it may be a temporary collaboration. It may not require a special name and can be regarded as a "virtual" role.</p>

        <p>A Business Collaboration can occur when two or more Business Roles need to fulfil specific interaction requirements. Business Collaborations represent the collective effort of combined Business Roles. </p>

        <p>The name of a Business Collaboration should preferably be a noun.</p>
