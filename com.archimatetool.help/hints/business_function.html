    <body>
        <p>A <b>Business Function</b> represents a collection of business behavior based on a chosen set of criteria (typically required business resources and/or competencies), closely aligned to an organization, but not necessarily explicitly governed by the organization.</p>

        <p>Business Processes describe a flow of activities. Business Functions group activities according to their required skills, knowledge, and resources. A Business Process forms a string of Business Functions.</p>
    
        <p>A Business Function may be triggered by, or trigger, any other business behaviour element (Business Event, Business Process, Business Function, or Business Interaction). A Business Function may access Business Objects. A Business Function may realize one or more BusinessServices and may use (internal) Business Services or Application Services. A Business role or an Application Component may be assigned to a Business Function.</p>
        
        <p>The name of a Business Function should clearly indicate a well-defined behaviour.</p>
