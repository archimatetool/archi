        <p>A <b>Business Object</b> represents a concept used within a particular business domain.</p>
        
        <p>A Business Object is used to model an object type of which several instances may exist within the organization. In this case, it may be realised as a Data Object or Representation. It may also be specialised by another Business Object.</p>
        
        <p>Business Objects are passive. They do not trigger or perform processes.</p>
        
        <p>Business Objects may be accessed by a Business Process, Function, Interaction, Event, or Service. A Business Object may have Association, Specialization, Aggregation, or Composition relationships with other Business Objects. A Business Object may be realized by a Representation or by a Data Object (or both).</p>
        
        <p>The name of a Business Object should preferably be a noun.</p>
