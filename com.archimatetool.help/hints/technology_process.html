        <p>A <b>Technology Process</b> represents a sequence of technology behaviours that achieves a specific result.</p>
        
        <p>A Technology Process describes internal behaviour of a Node. If its behaviour is exposed externally, this is done through one or more Technology Services. A Technology Process abstracts from the way it is implemented.</p>

        <p>A Technology Process may realize Technology Services. Other Technology Services may serve (be used by) a Technology Process. A Node may be assigned to a Technology Process, which means that this Node performs the process.</p>
        
        <p>The name of a Technology Process should clearly identify a series of technology behaviours using a verb or verb-noun combination.</p>
