        <p>A <b>Business Service</b> represents explicitly defined behavior that a Business Role, Business Actor, or Business Collaboration exposes to its environment.</p>
        
        <p>A Business Service is defined as the externally visible ("logical") functionality, which is meaningful to the environment and is realized by business behaviour (Business Process, Business Function, or Business Interaction).</p>
   	
        <p>A Business Service exposes the functionality of Business Roles or Collaborations to their environment. This functionality is accessed through one or more <em>business interfaces</em>. A Business Service is realized by one or more Business Processes, Business Functions, or Business Interactions that are performed by the Business Roles or Business Collaborations, respectively.</p>
        
        <p>The name of a Business Service should preferably be a verb ending with "-ing"; e.g., "transaction processing". Also, a name containing the word "service" may be used. </p>
