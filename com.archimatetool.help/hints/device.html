        <p>A <b>Device</b> represents a physical IT resource upon which system software and artifacts may be stored or deployed for execution.</p>
        
        <p>A Device is a specialization of a Node that represents a physical IT resource with processing capability. It is typically used to model hardware systems such as mainframes, PCs, or routers. Usually, they are part of a node together with system software. Devices may be composite; i.e., consist of sub-devices.</p>

        <p>Devices can be interconnected by Networks. Devices can be assigned to Artifacts and to System Software, to model that Artifacts and System Software are deployed on that Device. A Node can contain one or more Devices.</p>

        <p>The name of a Device should preferably be a noun referring to the type of hardware.</p>
