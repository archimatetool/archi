        <p>A <b>Business Role</b> represents the responsibility for performing specific behavior, to which an actor can be assigned, or the part an actor plays in a particular action or event.</p>
        
        <p>A Business Role can be fulfilled by more than one Business Actor. Conversely, a Business Actor may fulfil more than one Business Role. For example, given a named teacher, their roles may include those in the domains.</p>
        
        <p>A Business Role will usually exist in an organisation whether or not a given actor fulfils it or not.</p>

        <p>A Business Actor that is assigned to a Business Roleis responsible for ensuring that the corresponding behavior is carried out, either by performing it or by delegating and managing its performance</p>
