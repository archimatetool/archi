        <p>A <b>Technology Collaboration</b> represents an aggregate of two or more technology internal active structure elements that work together to perform collective technology behavior.</p>
        
        <p>A Technology Collaboration specifies which Nodes cooperate to perform some task. The collaborative behaviouris modeled by a Technology Interaction. A Technology Collaboration typically models a logical or temporary collaboration of Nodes, and does not exist as a separate entity in the enterprise.</p>

        <p>Technology Collaboration is a specialization of technology internal active structure element, and aggregates two or more (cooperating) Nodes and/or other Technology Collaborations. A Technology Collaboration may be assigned to one or more Technology Interactions or other technology internal behaviour elements, which model the associated behaviour. A technology interface may serve a Technology Collaboration, and a Technology Collaboration may be composed of Technology Interfaces.</p>
        
        <p>The name of a Technology Collaboration should preferably be a noun.</p>
