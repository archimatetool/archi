        <p>A <b>Technology Interface</b> represents a point of access where technology services offered by a Node can be accessed.</p>
        
        <p>A Technology Interface specifies how the technology services of a Node can be accessed by other Nodes. A Technology Interface exposes a Technology Service to the environment.</p>

        <p>A Technology Interface specifies a kind of contract that a component realizing this interface must fulfil.</p>

        <p>A Technology Interface may be part of a Node through composition, which means that these interfaces are provided by that Node, and can serve other Nodes. A Technology Interface can be assigned to a Technology Service, to expose that service to the environment.
