      <description>
         This cheat sheet shows you how to create a Map View of your existing Views in a model. A Map View contains shortcuts to Views that when double-clicked will open the linked View.<br/>
<br/>
You can also create these manually by dragging a View from the Models Tree to another view.<br/>
<br/>
This cheat sheet can create one for you automatically, provided you have the Models Tree open, that you have an Archimate model selected in the Models Tree, and the model has at least one View.

         Firstly, you need to ensure that the Models Tree is open. You can either do that manually from the <b>Window &gt; Models</b> main menu or from this cheat sheet automatically.
