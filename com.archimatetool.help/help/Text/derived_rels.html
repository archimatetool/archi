    <h1 class="pagebreak">Derived Relationships</h1>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    
    <p>There are two main types of relationship in the ArchiMate language, <em>structural</em> and <em>dynamic</em>. The structural relationships are as follows:</p>
    
    <table class="border">
      <tr>
        <td class="border">Association</td>
        <td class="border">Association models a relationship between objects that is not covered by another, more specific relationship.</td>
        <td class="border"><img src="../Images/rel-association.png"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="border">Access</td>
        <td class="border">The access relationship models the access of behavioural concepts to business or data objects.</td>
        <td class="border"><img src="../Images/rel-access.png"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="border">Used By</td>
        <td class="border">The used by relationship models the use of services by processes, functions, or interactions and the access to interfaces  by roles, components, or collaborations.</td>
        <td class="border"><img src="../Images/rel-usedby.png"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="border">Realisation</td>
        <td class="border">The realisation relationship links a logical entity with a more concrete entity that realizes it.</td>
        <td class="border"><img src="../Images/rel-realisation.png"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="border">Assignment</td>
        <td class="border">The assignment relationship links units of behaviour with active elements (e.g., roles, components) that perform them, or  roles with actors that fulfil them.</td>
        <td class="border"><img src="../Images/rel-assignment.png"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="border">Aggregation</td>
        <td class="border">The aggregation relationship indicates that an object groups a number of other objects.</td>
        <td class="border"><img src="../Images/rel-aggregation.png"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="border">Composition</td>
        <td class="border">The composition relationship indicates that an object consists of a number of other objects.</td>
        <td class="border"><img src="../Images/rel-composition.png"/></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <br/>
    
    <p>These structural relationships form an important category of relationships to describe coherence. They are listed here in ascending order by "strength": "Association" is the weakest structural relationship and "Composition" is the strongest.</p>
    
    <br/>
    
    <h2>Highlighting Structural Relationship Chains</h2>
    
    <p>If structural relationships exist in the ArchiMate model  these chains of relationships can be highlighted in red in the selected View. This option is available from the "Derived Relations -&gt; Show Structural Chains" menu  item from the main "View" menu or by right-clicking in a View. This option is a toggle and can be turned on and off for each separate View. If no structural chains of relationships exist in the model or if no structural connections have  been added to the View then nothing is highlighted in red.</p>
    
    <p class="boxout"><img src="../Images/tip.png" class="tipImage" />Note - only structural chains with at least two relations are shown, and all structural chains for all visible elements are shown. The structural chains are calculated <em>from the relationships in the model</em>. It is possible that not all of the relationships between elements are have been included in the current View, and therefore not all structural chains will be shown.
	</p>
    
    <br/>
    
    <h2>In Practice</h2>
    
    <p>Part of the language definition is an abstraction rule that states that two relationships that join at an intermediate element can be combined and replaced by the weaker of the two.</p>

    <p>With this rule, it is possible to determine the indirect, or  "derived" relationships that exist between model elements without a direct  relationship, which may be useful for, among other things, impact analysis. An  example is shown below. Assume that we would like to know what the impact on  the Client is if the CRM system fails. In this case, an indirect "used by"  relationship (the thick arrow on the left) can be derived from this system to  the Claim Registration Service (from the chain assignment -&gt; used by -&gt; realization -&gt; used by -&gt; realisation). No indirect (structural) relationship is  drawn between the CRM system and the Claims Payment Service.</p>

    <br/>
    
    <h2>Adding a Derived Relationship</h2>
    
    <p>To add a derived relationship to two elements in a View  select the "Derived Relations -&gt; Create Derived Relation..." menu item from  the main "View" menu or by right-clicking in a View. The "Create Derived  Relation" option is available when two and only two elements are selected in a View that have such a structural chain present <em>in the model</em>.</p>
    
    <p>The presence of such a chain is not dependent on what relationships (connections) are showing in that View, but on what actually exists in the underlying model (as seen in the Model Tree).</p>
    
    <p>It is possible that there exists more than one path (structural relationship chain) from the source element to the target element. This is shown in the ensuing dialog window.</p>
    To add a derived relationship, follow these steps:
    
    <ol>
      <li>Select two, and only two elements in a View. (Ctrl / Command click to select the two elements.)</li>
      <li>Select the "Derived Relations -&gt; Create Derived Relation..." menu item from the main "View" menu or by right-clicking in a View.</li>
      <li>If a derived relationship can be created a dialog window appears. It is possible that there exists more than one path (structural relationship chain) from the source element to the target element (or in reverse, from the target element to the source element):<br/>
        <br/>
      <img src="../Images/derived_dialog.png"/><br/>
      <br/>
      </li>
      <li>Choose the required relationship and click "OK".</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>If this is the first time a derived relationship has been  created for that model then a new folder is created in the Model Tree, labelled "Derived Relations". The newly created derived relationship is placed in that folder as are any new ones henceforth. If you wish to delete this folder you can do so.</p>
    
    <p>If a structural relationship already exists directly between element1 and element2 no further derived relationship is allowed.</p>
    
    <p>If there are too many possible paths to calculate between element1 and element2 then a warning message is displayed and the calculation is aborted.</p>
