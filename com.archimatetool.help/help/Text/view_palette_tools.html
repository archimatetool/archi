    <h2>Palette Selection Tools</h2>
    
    <p>There are two selection tools available in the Palette. These are used to select the objects in a diagram in various ways.</p>

    <p>The first tool (selection tool) is primarily used to select elements (boxes). When dragging a marquee area around elements and connections with this tool, <em>only</em> the elements (boxes) will be selected.</p>
    
    <p>The second tool (marquee tool) is activated by a drop-down button and is used to select <em>both</em> elements and connections in various ways:</p>

    <p>You can add elements or connections to a selection with the selection tool by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking on the element or connection. The same operation can be used to remove an element or connection from a selection.</p>
  
    <p>When several elements or connections are selected, one will be marked with dark handles. This is called the primary selection.</p>
