    <h2>Export View As Image</h2>
    
    <p>A View (diagram) can be exported as an image file to disk.  This is available from the "Export View As Image..." menu command from the main "File-&gt;Export" menu or by right-clicking on a View and selecting the menu item from the contextual menu. This menu command is only available if a View is open and selected.</p>
    
    <p>Available formats are BMP, JPG, PNG, PDF and SVG. The first three formats can be exported at scaled ranging from 25% to 400%. SVG format has more options including embedding font information and setting the viewBox bounds for different scales.</p>
