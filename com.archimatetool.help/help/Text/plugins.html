    <h1 class="pagebreak">Managing Plug-ins</h1>
    <p>You can install and uninstall Archi plug-ins with the Archi Plug-ins Manager or manually.</p>
    
    <h2>Using the Plug-ins Manager</h2>
    <p>To install or uninstall an Archi plug-in, select "Manage Plug-ins..." from the Help menu.</p>
    
    <p>The Archi Plug-ins Manager dialog will show. From here you can view installed plug-ins and their details.</p>
    
    <h3>Installing</h3>
    <p>To install an Archi plug-in using this method you need to have the plug-in in Archi plug-in format. This is an archive file (*.archiplugin or *.zip file extension) containing one or more jar files and a marker file. Examples of this type of Archi plug-in are the Collaboration and jArchi Scripting plug-ins. If the plug-in is a jar file you will need to install it manually (see below).</p>
    
    <p>To install a new plug-in, click the "Install New..." button. Select the plug-in file or files that you wish to install. You can select and install more than one plug-in if you wish. You will be prompted to restart Archi.</p>
    
    <h3>Uninstalling</h3>
    <p>Installed plug-ins will be displayed in the table view in the dialog. If you wish to install one or more plug-ins, select them and click the "Uninstall" button. You will be prompted to restart Archi.</p>

    <br/>
    
    <h2>Manual installation</h2>
    <p>If the plug-in is in *.jar file format you can simply copy the *.jar file(s) to Archi's special "dropins" directory. (Ensure you quit Archi first before doing this.)</p>
    
    <p>The "dropins" directory is located in the following places:</p>
    <p>Windows: user.home/AppData/Roaming/Archi4/dropins</p>
    <p>Mac: user.home/Library/Application Support/Archi4/dropins</p>
    <p>Linux: user.home/.archi4/dropins</p>

    <p>("user.home" denotes your home directory.)</p>

    <p>If the "dropins" directory does not exist, you will need to create it first.</p>
