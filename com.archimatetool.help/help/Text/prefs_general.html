	<h3>Files</h3>
	<p><strong>Automatically open Views in a Model when opening from file</strong><br/>
	When opening a Model from a file, choose whether to automatically open all the Views in the model.</p>

	<p><strong>Automatically create a backup file (*.bak) when saving</strong><br/>
	If this is ticked, whenever an .archimate file is saved, a backup copy with file extension .bak will be created first.</p>

	<p><strong>Size of recently opened file list</strong><br/>
	Set the cached sized of the recently opened file list in the "File-&gt;Open Recent" menu. Can be set from 3 - 15.</p>
	
	<br/>

	<h3>Appearance</h3>
	<p><strong>Theme</strong><br/>
	Choose the theme to use for Archi. A restart may be required for the theme changes to fully take effect.
	<br/>If the theme is set to "Automatically select Light/Dark" then the theme will be set according to the current operating system setting of light or dark (Mac Mojave and later only).</p>
	
	<p><strong>Show Status Bar</strong><br/>
	Show or hide the status bar. A restart will be required for changes to take effect.</p>

	<br/>

	<h3>Model Tree</h3>
	<p><strong>Display unused concepts in italics</strong><br/>
	When this is ticked, any elements or relations that are not used in Views are displayed in an Italic font.</p>

	<p><strong>Update search result as you type</strong><br/>
	When this is ticked, search results in the Model Tree are updated as you type (default). If not ticked the search result will update when the Return key is pressed.</p>

	<p><strong>Always warn when deleting objects</strong><br/>
	When this is ticked a warning is always displayed when objects are deleted in the Models Tree. If unticked, a warning is only displayed when deleting objects if the objects are used in Views.</p>
	
	<br/>

	<h3>Other</h3>
	<p><strong>Export images at 2x size</strong><br/>
	When this is ticked, images are exported and copied to the clipboard at twice their normal size. This is set on by default for Windows operating systems where display scaling is set to 200% or more in order that images are correctly created. This setting is usually not needed on Mac Retina or Linux displays, so it's best to leave this turned off.</p>
