    <h2>ArchiMate Element Appearance Properties</h2>
    
    <p>Selecting an ArchiMate Element in a View means that you can edit or view additional visual properties in the Properties Window. Different visual settings can be applied to an element for each separate occurrence in a View. For example, the element "Application Service" may be coloured blue in one View, and grey in another View.</p>

For example you may wish to display the element's name and its type. Or you may wish to display the value of one or more of its properties.</p>
