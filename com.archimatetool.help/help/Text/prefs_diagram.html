    <h2>View</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Grid Size</strong>
        <br/>Sets the grid spacing used in diagram Views.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Palette is open when opening Views</strong>
        <br/>If enabled the palette in a View will be open when the View is opened.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Show tooltips in Views</strong>
        <br/>If enabled tooltips in Views will be shown.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Edit name after creating new object from Palette</strong>
        <br/>If enabled when a new element is added from the Palette you can immediately
        edit its name.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Show Specializations in Palette</strong>
        <br/>If enabled specialized concepts will be shown in the Palette. New specialized concepts can be created like any other concept from the Palette.
    </p>

    <br/>

    <h2>Viewpoints</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Grey out disallowed concepts in the Model Tree</strong>
        <br/>When this option is set any concepts that are disallowed in a Viewpoint
        are greyed out. For more information see <a href="viewpoints.html">Viewpoints</a>.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Hide disallowed concepts from the Palette</strong>
        <br/>When this option is set any concepts that are disallowed in a Viewpoint
        are not shown in the Palette. For more information see <a href="viewpoints.html">Viewpoints</a>.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Hide disallowed concepts from the Magic Connector</strong>
        <br/>When this option is set any concepts that are disallowed in a Viewpoint
        are not shown in the Magic Connector. For more information see <a href="viewpoints.html">Viewpoints</a>.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ghost disallowed concepts in a View</strong>
        <br/>When this option is set disallowed concepts in a Viewpoint are "ghosted" out. For more information see <a href="viewpoints.html">Viewpoints</a>.</p>
    <p></p>
    
    <br/>

    <h2>Paste Special behaviour</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Always paste a reference to copied element</strong>
        <br/>When this option is set copied elements in a diagram always reference the original elements.</p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Always paste a duplicate of copied element</strong>
        <br/>When this option is set copied elements in a diagram are always duplicates of the original elements.</p>

    <p>For more information see <a href="view_copy_paste_delete.html">Copying, Pasting, Selecting and Deleting Elements</a>.</p>
    
    <br/>
    
    <h2>Resize behaviour</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Child object positions are fixed (default)</strong>
        <br/>When this option is set child objects maintain their absolute position when the parent object's top/left is resized. Resizing at the top or left will create new space in the parent object.</p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Child object positions are relative to parent</strong>
        <br/>When this option is set child objects maintain their relative position to the parent object when the parent object's top/left is resized. Resizing at the top or left will not create new space in the parent object.</p>
    
    <br/>

    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Use older method for drawing images</strong>
        <br/>When this option is set an older method for drawing scaled images is used in Canvas image figures. It is faster but image transparency is not preserved. By default this should be disabled but the option is included for backward compatibility.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Use an offset when drawing outlines on hi-res displays</strong>
        <br/>When this option is set figure outlines are drawn with a small offset to compensate for higher resolution displays. This is normally only needed on Windows devices with hi-res displays.</p>
    <br/>
    
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
	
	<br/>
    
    <h3>Global</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Word wrap style</strong>
        <br/>Set the default word wrap style for ArchiMate figures.<br/>
        <br/><em>Hard</em> - wrapping will only occur at valid line breaks.
        <br/><em>Soft</em> - wrapping will always occur at the end of the available space, breaking in the middle of a word.
        <br/><em>Truncated</em> - wrapping will always occur at the end of available space, truncating a word if it doesn't fit.
    </p>

    <h3>Defaults for new ArchiMate figures</h3>

    <p>These are the defaults to use when creating a <em>new</em> ArchiMate figure. You can change these settings individually thereafter.</p>
