    <h2>Relationship Connection Appearance Properties</h2>
    
    <p>Selecting an ArchiMate Relationship in a View means that you can edit or view additional visual properties in the Properties Window. Different visual settings can be applied to a relationship for each separate occurrence in a View. For example, the relationship "Used By" may be coloured black in one View, and blue in another View.</p>

    <p class="caption">Adding a Label Expression to display in the View</p>

    <p>This tab is only available when a relationship is selected in a View.</p>

    <p>By default, a relationship's name will be displayed in any View in which it appears. Using a label expression per View instance, you can choose what is displayed for the relationship in the View. For example you may wish to display the relationship's name and its type. Or you may wish to display the value of one or more of its properties.</p>
