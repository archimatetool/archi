    <h1 class="pagebreak">Exporting the Model and its Views</h1>
    
    <p>It is possible to export the Archi model or its Views to different formats in order to re-use the model or images in different applications.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2>Export Model To CSV</h2>
    
    <p>This option is available from the "Export Model To  CSV..." menu item from the main "File-&gt;Export" menu. Once a model is selected in the Model Tree or in a View this menu item is enabled. Provide a  filename to export the file in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format.</p>
    
    <p>The CSV field format is as follows:</p>
    
    <p>"Type", "Element name", "Documentation", "Source type", "Source name", "Target type", "Target name"</p>
    <p>Elements and Relationships are exported. The last four fields only apply to the Relationship type. For an element they are left blank.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2>Export View As Image</h2>
    
    <p>A View (diagram) can be exported as an image file to disk.  This is available from the "Export View As Image..." menu command from the main  "File-&gt;Export" menu or by right-clicking on a View and selecting the menu  item from the contextual menu. This menu command is only available if a View is open and selected.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h2>Export View As Image to Clipboard</h2>
    
    <p>A  View (diagram) can be exported (or copied) as an image to the system clipboard.  This is available from the "Export View As Image To Clipboard" menu command from the main "File-&gt;Export" menu or by right-clicking on a View and  selecting the menu item from the contextual menu. This menu command is only  available if a View is open and selected. A useful shortcut key combination is  Ctrl-Shift-C (Command key on Mac). Once the View is exported to the system clipboard it can be  pasted into other applications such as word processing and drawing tools.</p>
