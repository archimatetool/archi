    <h1 class="pagebreak">Importing Another Model into the Current Model</h1>

    <p>It is possible to import and merge another Archi model into the currently selected model. You can then maintain the imported model as a reference model that you can update separately and re-import as required.</p>

    <p>Some things to consider when importing another model:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Model objects are uniquely referenced by their type and identifier. When importing a model, these are used to match the imported objects to the target objects.</li>
        <li>All User Properties for an object are replaced when importing, there is no merging at this level.</li>
        <li>Some changes in the imported model might affect connections in Views if relationships are changed or deleted. These are reported in the status dialog after import.</li>
        <li>Existing target objects and folders will not be deleted even if these are deleted from the imported model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importing another Archi model</h2>

    <p>To import another Archi model into the currently selected model select "Import an Archi model into the currently selected model" from the main "File" menu. The following dialog will appear:</p>

    <h3>Import Options</h3>

    <p><strong>Update existing objects and folders</strong><br/>
    If this is selected then any existing target objects and folders will be updated when importing.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Update model information and top-level folders</strong><br/>
    If this is selected then if there are any changes to the model node (Name, Documentation, Properties) these will be updated. If there are changes to any top-level folders (Documentation, Properties) these will also be updated.</p>

    <p><strong>Show Status Dialog after importing</strong><br/>
    If this is selected then a status dialog is shown after importing a model. This will list what was updated or changed.</p>
