    <h2>Working with Views</h2>
    
    <p>Once a View has been opened you may now "draw" on the canvas, adding and creating new ArchiMate elements, connections (relationships) and annotations (notes). As you add figures to the canvas from the palette, the corresponding ArchiMate elements and relationships are added to the ArchiMate model and are visible in the Model Tree.</p>
    
    <p>You also add existing concepts to the View by dragging and dropping them from the Model Tree into the View. You can add new elements to the Model Tree (see <a href="model_tree_add.html">Adding Elements Directly to the Model Tree</a>) and then drag them to any number of Views in the model. Thus, elements and relations can appear in more than one View, each occurrence referencing the same concept in the Model. Thus, if you change the name of the model concept it will change for all occurrences in all Views.</p>
