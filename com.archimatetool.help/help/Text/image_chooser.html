    <h2>Adding Images to Objects</h2>
    
    <p>ArchiMate objects, Notes, Groups, Canvas Blocks, Image objects and Stickies can contain images. The images in Blocks and Stickies are resized to a maximum width and height of 100 pixels when the image position is not set to "Fill". Images can be any size but we suggest that you keep them reasonably small so as not to consume too much memory.</p>
    
    <p>To add an image to one of these objects, open the Properties window and select the object. Double-clicking the object will also open the Properties window. Find the Image tab in the Properties window and select the Image Chooser with the "Image Choose..." button:</p>
    
    <img src="../Images/image_chooser.png" alt="image" width="200" height="109" />
    <p class="caption">Selecting the Image Chooser from the Properties window</p>

    <p>Note - In order to set an image for an ArchiMate object you must first ensure that "Custom " is selected in the Image source dropdown.</p>
    
    <p>This will open the "My Images" Image Chooser dialog window:</p>
    
    <img src="../Images/image_chooser_dialog.png" alt="image" width="647" height="539" />
    <p class="caption">The Image Chooser dialog window</p>
    
    <p>All images that are contained in any loaded models are displayed in the Chooser so that you can re-use them. If you want to open an image file from your computer select the "Open from File..." option.</p>
    
    <br/>

    <p class="boxout"><img src="../Images/tip.png" class="tipImage" alt="tip" width="40" height="40" />In Canvas Views, you can drag and drop Image files from the desktop to the Canvas.</p>

    <br/>

    <h3>Supported image formats</h3>
    
    <p>Supported image formats are PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, TIF, TIFF, BMP, ICO and SVG.</p>
    
    <h4>SVG Support</h4>

    <p>Note that SVG image support is available only in Archi 5.8.0 and later versions, and it is not backward compatible with earlier versions of Archi. If you are using SVG images in a model ensure that all users who share the model are using Archi 5.8.0 or later.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Opening a model from a coArchi or coArchi2 repository that contains SVG images in an earlier version of Archi, and then re-saving it, can result in the loss of those SVG images from the model.</strong></p>
    
    <p>To help prevent this, when opening a model created in Archi 5.8.0 or later with an older version, you will be prompted to confirm whether you wish to proceed.</p>

    <p>Additionally, when exporting a View (diagram) as an SVG image, any figures that incorporate SVG images will be rendered as raster images. This can result in poor quality when figures containing SVG images are resized larger than their native size (scaled up).</p>
        
    <p>For the best results, use SVG images with a large native width and height, and ensure that figures display them at their original size, or, if resizing is necessary, scale them down rather than up.</p>
    
    <br/>

    <h3>Removing an image from an object</h3>
    <p>To remove an image from an object select the "Remove Image" option from the Image Chooser.</p>

    <br/>

    <p class="boxout"><img src="../Images/tip.png" class="tipImage" alt="tip" width="40" height="40" /><strong>Archi uses a different file format for "*.archimate" files when adding images.</strong><br/>Normally Archi saves "*.archimate" files as single plain text XML format files. However, when images are used the file format used is a binary archive file (zip format) that contains both the model's XML file and the image files. This is to keep all related files together.</p>
