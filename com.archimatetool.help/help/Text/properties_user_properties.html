    <p class="caption">User Properties</p>
    
    <p>This tab allows you to add arbitrary User Properties, or attributes, to a Concept, Model, Folder, or View. For example you may wish to add information such as "Cost", "Location", "Duration", "Time", "Link" and so on. Properties are stored as name/value pairs. Properties with the same name may appear more than once in the model or object and values are free text.</p>
    
    <p>If the value of a Property starts with "http://", "https://" or "ftp://" it will show in blue to denote a hyperlink and an icon will be displayed in the left column. Double-clicking on the icon will open the link in a Browser.</p>
