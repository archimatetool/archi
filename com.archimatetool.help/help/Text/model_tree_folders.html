    <h2>Folders and Organisation</h2>
    
    <p>A model in Archi is organised into a folder structure representing the ArchiMate layers and the concepts' relationships. A new model comprises the following top level folders:</p>
    
    <table>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Business</strong></td>
        <td>Contains the elements in the "Business" layer and any user-created sub-folders</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Application</strong></td>
        <td>Contains the elements in the "Application" layer and any user-created sub-folders</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Technology</strong></td>
        <td>Contains the elements in the "Technology" layer and any user-created sub-folders</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Motivation</strong></td>
        <td>Contains the elements in the "Motivation" category and any user-created sub-folders</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Implementation &amp; Migration</strong></td>
        <td>Contains the elements in the "Implementation &amp; Migration" category and any user-created sub-folders</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Other</strong></td>
        <td>Contains the Location, Grouping, and Junction type elements and any user-created sub-folders</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Relations</strong></td>
        <td>Contains the relationships between concepts as they are created in Views (diagrams) and any user-created sub-folders</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><strong>Views</strong></td>
        <td>Contains links to Views (diagrams)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>ArchiMate elements can be created and deleted directly in the Model Tree (see <a href="model_tree_add.html">Adding Elements Directly to the Model Tree</a>) or are automatically added to the appropriate type folder as objects are drawn onto the canvas of a View (see <a href="view_addnew.html">Adding New Elements to the View from the Palette</a>). All concepts in a folder are automatically sorted alphabetically.</p>
    
    <br/>
    
    <h3>User Sub-Folders</h3>
    
    <p>User sub-folders can be created under the main top-level folders. This allows you to organise the concepts in any way you wish. To add a new sub-folder to the Model Tree, select a top-level folder (or a user-created sub-folder), and right-click. A "New" menu item allows you to add a new sub-folder to the tree.</p>
    
    <p>Note that a sub-folder can only contain concepts of the same type as the topmost parent folder. For example, only "Business" type concepts can be created in the "Business" folder and any of its sub-folders.</p>
    
    <p>You can also drag and drop concepts and sub-folders within the same folder branch, but not across folders of different types.</p>
    
    <p>To rename a sub-folder in the Model Tree choose "Rename" from the main Edit menu or from the right-click context menu.</p>
