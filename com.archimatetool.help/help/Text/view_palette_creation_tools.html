    <h2>Palette Creation Tools</h2>
    
    <p>Apart from the <a href="view_palette_tools.html">Selection Tools</a> there are other tools available on the Palette used to create new ArchiMate concepts, Notes, Groups and Relations between concepts (connections). To add a new element to the canvas select one and drag it onto or click onto the canvas.</p>
    
    <h3>Relations</h3>
    
    <p>There are several types of ArchiMate relation and a Junction element.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Relations Creation Tools in the Palette</p>
    
    <p>The first tool is the <a href="view_magic_connector.html">Magic Connector</a>, used for drawing connections. This is followed by creation tools for ArchiMate relations and a Junction element.</p>
    
    <h3>Notes and Groups</h3>
    
    <p>Used for adding a Note, Group Container, or a Note Connection to a View.</p>

    <p class="boxout"><strong><img src="../Images/tip.png" class="tipImage"/>Tip: Press the shift key when selecting a palette tool or double-click to keep it selected.</strong><br/>By default, once an element or connection has been drawn on the canvas the default selection tool (arrow) is re-selected on the palette. If you wish to keep the current palette tool selected hold the "Shift" key down when you select it or double-click on it. A single click will clear this option.</p>
