    <h2>Connection Bend-points</h2>
    
    <p>A connection line (relationship) can have any number of bend-points so that the connection can be routed to form bends and deviations in the diagram.</p>
    
    <p>To add a bend-point to a connection firstly select the connection. A bend-point "handle", or dot, will appear in the middle of the connection:</p>

    <p class="caption">A connection bend-point "handle"</p>
    
    <p>Drag the bend-point handle in the desired direction. Notice that as you drag the handle two new bend-point handles are added to the connection:</p>
    
    <img src="../Images/bendpoint2.png"/>
    <p class="caption">Connection bend-point "handles" appear</p>
    
    <p>You can continue to select and drag these handles to create new bend-points. As each new bend-point is created, two new handles will appear either side of the selected handle.</p>
    
    <p>To delete a bend-point,  select the bend-point's handle and drag it so that the connection line becomes straight. Once the connection line is straightened the bend-point will disappear.</p>
    
    <p>Bend points snap to grid if "Snap to Grid" is turned on in the "View" menu. If you need finer control over placing the bend-point you can over-ride this by holding down the Alt key on Windows, Alt/Shift on Linux, or the Ctrl key on Mac.</p>
    
    <p>Note - bend-points cannot be added to connections if the Connection Router Type for the View is set to "Manhattan". See <a href="view_conn_router.html">here</a> for more details.</p>
