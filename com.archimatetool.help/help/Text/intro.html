	<p><strong>Archi</strong><sup>&reg;</sup> is an open source, cross-platform tool to create ArchiMate<sup>&reg;</sup> models.</p>

    <p>The Archi<sup>&reg;</sup> modelling toolkit is targeted toward all levels of Enterprise Architects and Modellers. It provides a low cost to entry solution to users who may be making their first steps in the ArchiMate modelling language, or who are looking for an open source, cross-platform ArchiMate modelling tool for their company or institution and wish to engage with the language within a TOGAF<sup>&reg;</sup> or other Enterprise Architecture framework.</p>
    
	<p>Since its introduction, Archi has been widely adopted for real-world use in the commercial and educational sectors and is used by major global companies and consultants. It is the <em>de facto</em> open source ArchiMate modelling tool.</p>
    
	<p>The <a href="https://www.opengroup.org/archimate-forum">ArchiMate</a><sup>&reg;</sup> modelling language is an open and independent Enterprise Architecture standard that supports the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across business domains.</p>
	
	<p>ArchiMate is one of the open standards hosted by <a href="https://www.opengroup.org/" target="_blank">The Open Group</a><sup>&reg;</sup> and is fully aligned with <a href="https://www.opengroup.org/togaf" target="_new">TOGAF</a><sup>&reg;</sup>.</p>
