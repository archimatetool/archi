/**
 * Version number of model.<p>
 * Use this to determine when loading a different version model if it will bring the whole
 * show down. Example, folders were introduced in version 1.3 of Archi but won't open in Archi 1.2.<p>
 * 
 * PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS THE VERSION OF THE MODEL, NOT ARCHI.
 * As from Archi version 2.6.0 I will try to keep the model version number the same as Archi's version number when the model version is incremented.
 * Only need to change the model version number if there are changes that affect backwards compatibility.<p>
 *
